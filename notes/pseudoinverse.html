  <h1>Notes on the pseudoinverse</h1>
  <p>2019-10-25</p>

  <p>Reading: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Optimal-Control-Estimation-Dover-Mathematics-ebook/dp/B00A3M0ZNW/">Optimal Control and Estimation</a> by Stengel, from page 299.</p>
  
  <p>
    Suppose we have an equation like \(y = Ax\), where \(x\) and \(y\)
    are column vectors, not necessarily of the same size, and \(A\) is
    a matrix.  We want to solve for \(x\) in terms of \(y\).  If \(A\)
    is invertible, then the answer is simply \(x=A^{-1}y\).
  </p>

  <p>
    If \(A\) is not invertible &mdash; perhaps because it represents a
    system that is either over- or under-determined &mdash; we might want
    to solve the equation in the least squares sense.  I'm
    particularly interested in this from the point of view of state
    estimation: suppose our system has state \(x\) but we only observe
    a projection \(y = A x\).
    What's the <i>best</i> value of \(x\) given \(y\)? To do so we can
    define the mean-squared-error and then use the usual techniques to
    minimize it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    \(J(x) = |y - Ax|^2\)
  </p>

  <p>
    \(J(x) = \left(y - Ax\right)^T \left(y - Ax\right)\)
  </p>

  <p>
    \(J(x) = y^T y - (Ax)^T y - y^T A x + (Ax)^T Ax \)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    \(J(x) = y^T y - (Ax)^T y - y^T A x + (Ax)^T Ax \)
  </p>

  <p>
    \(J(x) = y^T y - x^T A^T y - y^T A x + x^T A^T Ax \)
  </p>

  <p>Each term in this sum is a scalar value, and therefore equal to
    its own transpose - so we can transpose the term \( x^T A^T y\)
    and find that it is equal to its neighbor:</p>

  <p>
    \(J(x) = y^T y - 2 y^T A x + x^T A^T Ax \)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now it is time to take the derivative of \(J(x)\) with respect to
    the column vector \(x\). By setting this derivative to zero and
    solving, we can find the extrema of \(J(x)\). To do this
    completely mechanically, we would have to define, for example,
    what it means to take the derivative of a row-vector with respect
    to a column vector and so forth. I believe there are conventions
    here, but in ignorance of them we will utilize a small trick: it
    turns out that
    the <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/q/189434/2191">derivative
    of the quadratic form</a> \(x^T Hx\) with respect to \(x\) is
    \(x^T\left(H + H^T\right)\). So:
  </p>

  <p>
    \({\partial J(x)}/{\partial x} = -2 y^T A + 2 x^T\left(A^T A\right)\)
  </p>

  <p>Setting the derivative to zero and solving, we find:</p>
  <p>
    \(y^T A = x^T A^T A\)
  </p>

  <p>
    \(A y = A^T A x\)
  </p>

  <p>
    Supposing the inverse  \(\left(A^T A\right)^{-1}\) exists:
  </p>

  <p>
    \(x = \left(A^T A\right)^{-1} A^T y\)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This quantity \(\left(A^T A\right)^{-1} A^T\) is the left
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooreâ€“Penrose_inverse">pseudoinverse</a>
    of \(A\).

    I found it instructive to try calculating this pseudoinverse for
    various examples of \(A\) like \([1, 0]\) (underdetermined) or
    \([1, 1, 1]^T\) (overdetermined). (The text of Stengel has some
    good examples.)
  </p>

  <p>
    It turns out that the left pseudoinverse exists when \(A\) is
    over-determined, but not when it's under-determined.
      
    What do we do in that case? Wikipedia says that at least one of
    the left and right pseudoinverses always exists. Does the right
    pseudoinverse do us any good?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In state estimation we are typically interested in
    the <i>underdetermined</i> case, where we can measure only an
    incomplete projection of the state on any given
    measurement. (Stengel derives the seeminly magical Kalman update
    equations a bit later on page 332.)
